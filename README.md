# Image Processing

The goal of the project is to develop a tool that allows images to be loaded and a variety of customizable filters to be applied, based on mathematical principles. 

The implementation of these techniques will provide a deep understanding of how digital images can be transformed by calculations on pixel arrays, providing an interactive platform to explore these concepts.
